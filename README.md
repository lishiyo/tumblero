#Tumblero

##Minimal Viable Product: Features
Barebones tumblr - you can create multiple blogs and posts for each blog, and follow other blogs. If you follow a blog, you'll see their posts on your dashboard home. You can also "like" and "reblog" posts onto your own blog(s).

**Users can** :

1. Have many blogs and posts, and one dashboard
2. Create Posts (4 types, with attachments): Text, Photo, Link, Quote
3. Follow/unfollow Blogs (get dashboard working!)
4. Like Posts
5. Reblog Posts onto one or more owned blogs
6. Sort posts on dashboard by Recent, Trending (fast-rising in last 24 hours), Popular (week/month/all-time)


##Additional Features
1. Search and Explore: 
  * Users can Tag Posts
  * Explore by Trending (all)
  * Explore by Tags
	  * both the most popular posts
	  * and the most popular blogs in these tags
2. Comment on Posts
  * nested dropdown like Reddit
  * sort by most-liked 
3. Recommended Blogs to follow widget
  * inspired by Twitter - refresh
